# Marketing Strategies

## Positioning
“The home for RC racing clubs and fans — results, events, and the parts you need — with real revenue back to local tracks.”

## Go-to-Market (Phase 1: 0–90 days)
1. **Anchor Tenants:** Onboard 2–3 local/regional tracks; free setup + rev share
2. **Content Flywheel:** Publish result recaps, photo galleries, “car of the week”
3. **Promo → Commerce:** CMS promos on tenant pages → product collections with clear CTAs
4. **Pilot Sponsorships:** Offer 3 simple sponsor packages (Bronze/Silver/Gold) tied to high-traffic pages (events/results)

## Channels
- **Tenant Microsites:** Primary; SEO via static pages & structured data
- **Email Digests:** Weekly “Upcoming races + Top results + Deals”
- **Social:** Short race highlights, driver spotlights, sponsor shoutouts
- **Partner Co-Marketing:** Brands/shops promote your recaps & leaderboards

## Sponsor Packages (Pilot)
- **Bronze ($250/event):** Logo on event page + recap
- **Silver ($500/event):** Bronze + homepage banner on tenant site + 1 social shoutout
- **Gold ($1,000/event):** Silver + placement on results pages + product promo block

## Content Calendar (example)
- Mon: Weekend Results Recap (multi-tenant roundup)
- Wed: Driver Spotlight + Class setup tips
- Fri: Upcoming Events + Featured Promo (linked collection)
- Event Day: Live updates thread + gallery upload

## KPIs
- Tenant growth: +2 per month
